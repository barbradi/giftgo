- The feature flag solution has been implemented using conditional beans, it could be implemented in several alternative ways: Unleash, read properties, refresh context ...
- It is not clear what to validate in the file so I've made some easy assumptions
- I've tried to follow hexagonal architecture, I found it's a nice way to organise and standarise how microservices code and packages structure
- For testing, I've primarily used the libraries MockK, AssertK, JsonUnit, MockMvc and WebTestClient. However, there are other capable libraries available
- WebTestClient although it comes from webflux project, Spring encourages it to use it everywhere, even in non reactive projects (bring the dependency in test context only), it supports:
  - Integration Test
  - Spring MVC test
  - Mock servlet: mock security, mock user 
  - deserialize to Object, String, arrays, list
  - json assertions
  - reactive and non-reactive
- For a quick overview just check **FileParsingIntegrationTest**
